# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
# Overview of the analysis
With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, you’ll use the features in the provided dataset to help Beks create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.
## Purpose of this analysis
Using your knowledge of Pandas and the Scikit-Learn’s StandardScaler(), we’ll need to preprocess the dataset in order to compile, train, and evaluate the neural network model. Using our knowledge of TensorFlow, we’ll design a neural network to create a binary classification model that can predict if an Alphabet Soup–funded organization will be successful based on the features in the dataset. Once we’ve completed that step, we’ll compile, train, and evaluate the binary classification model to calculate the model’s loss and accuracy. Using our knowledge of TensorFlow, optimize the model in order to achieve a target predictive accuracy higher than 75%. 
# Results
## Data Preprocessing
- What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
- What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
- What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
- What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
